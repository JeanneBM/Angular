Use a RHEL System Role to set up network cards in managed machines:
1. You can use a simple configuration where the interface is set to DHCP
2. Configure your virtual machine with an additional network card (you can do this test on an additional network card to avoid from throwing away
   your current configuration and losing your connection)

Analyze the procject that is in the lesson10/lab directory:
1. Make sure that you have cloned the Github repository in order to access it
2. Optimize it for use in a large environment 
3. You will notice that lesson 10 lab is not organized in the most efficient way - apply everything you've learned in this lesson to optimize it
   for use in a large environment. There are some errors as well - You don't have to fix the errors yet.

Work on the same lab project that we've worked on in lesson 10:
1. Debug it
2. Get out all of the errors
