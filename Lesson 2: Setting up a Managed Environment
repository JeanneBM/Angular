2.1 Setting up Static Inventory 

			DNS/

			Inventory	------------> 	    dynamic
			* groups
			* variables	------------> 	    static

Managing Static Inventory:
* In a minimal form, a static inventory is a list of host names and IP addresses that can be managed by Ansible 
* Hosts can be grouped in inventory to make it easy to address multiple hosts at once 
* A host can be a member of multiple groups 
* Nested groups are also avaliable
* It is common to work with project-based inventory files
* Variables can be set from the inventory file - but this is deprecated practice
* Ranges can be used:
	* server[1:20] matches server1 up to server20
	* 192.168.[4:5].[0:255] matches two full class C subnets

Inventory File Locations 
* /etc/ansible/hosts is the dafault inventory
* Alternative inventory location can be specified through the ansible.cfg configuration file 
* Or use the -i inventory option to specify the location of the inventory file to use
* It is common practice to put the inventory file in the current project directory

Host Groups Usage:
* Functional host groups:	
	* web
	* lamp
* Regional host groups:
	* europa
	* africa
* Staging host groups:
	* test
	* development
	* production


mkdir install
cd install
