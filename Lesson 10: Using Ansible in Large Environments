10.1 Managing Inventory

Understanding Inventory Options:
* A static inventory file can be used as a list of managed hosts
* Dynamic inventory can automatically discover hosts, by talking to an external host management system, such as FreeIPA, Active Directory, 
  Red Hat Satelite and more
* Also, multiple inventories can be used, for instance by putting multiple inventory files in a directory and use that as the source 
  of inventory

Managing Dynamic Inventory:
* Dynamic inventory scripts are avaliable for different environments
	* Check https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/contrib/inventory
* They are used like static inventory files, through ansible.cfg, or using the -i option to the ansible[-playbook] command
* Instead of using community dynamic inventory scripts, you can also write your own

Writing Dynamic Inventory Scripts:
* The only requirement is that the script returns the inventory information in JSON format 
* To see the correct output format, use ansible-inventory --list on any inventory
* Scripts can be written in any language, but Python is common

Using Multiple Inventory Files:
* If the inventory specified is a directory, all inventory files in that directory are considered
* This includes as well as dynamic inventory
* Inventory files cannot be created with dependencies to other inventory files


ansible-inventory --list
vim pascal.py
./pascal.py --list
